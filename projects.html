          <h2>ROCKET SAT</h2>
          <subtitle>- University of Northern Colorado -</subtitle>
          <p>Rocket SAT is a program funded by the Colorado Space Grant Consortium for students to design and build a sounding rocket payload and launch the payload on a rocket out of Wallops Flight Facility. Payloads are student-built and reviewed extensively by NASA engieers to provide rigorous aerospace engineering experience to undergraduate students.</p>
          <p>There are two variants of Rocket SAT:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"Rocket SAT - C" - Sounding rocket with a pressurized payload section</li>
            <li>"Rocket SAT - X" - Sounding rocket with an unpressurized payload section with ferring seperation at apogee</li>
          </ul>          
          <h3>2012</h3>
          <p>The Rocket SAT-X program allows for deployable out of the rocket (once the rocket reaches an apogee of 160km). The ReEntry Experiment (ReX) Capsule was designed to be jettisoned from the rocket body, where it reentered the earth's atmosphere while taking large amounts of inertial-dynamic data relating to the amount of air resistance experienced by the vehicle body. The payload was required to survive the violent reentry process, terrestrial impact, and was to be recovered from the Atlantic Ocean several hours after launch. This project launched in August of 2011. View the ReX team's submission to the 2012 Colorado Space Grant Space Symposium <a href="./documents/Rex_Paper.pdf">here</a></p>
