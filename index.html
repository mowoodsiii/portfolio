                          <p>Hello there! I'm Maurice Woods - Physicist and space junky from Colorado. Born in California and raised in Southern Colorado, I've spent the past nine years of my life devoted to becoming the best, most well-rounded engineer that I can be. </p>
                          <p>At present, I'm enrolled in the Masters of Aerospace Engineering program at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where I am focusing on control systems and embedded systems engineering. Since my enrollment, I've explored embedded systems (hardware and software) design, software defined radio communications systems, and spacecraft attitude dynamics, determination, and control. Additionally, I've been involved in two cubesat missions (one of which will launch in March 2017), explored small hobbyist robotics projects, and exercised my electrical and software development and debugging skills as a porject consultant and a Teaching Assistant at CU's Inegrated Technology and Learning Laboratory.</p>
                          <p>I have compliled a portfolio of my notable <a href="#projects">projects</a> and <a href="#skills">skills</a> in the hopes that you might find something interesting! If, by chance, you'd care to contact me, consider my contact information below:</p>

                                        <h3>UNP MAXWELL CubeSat Mission</h3>
                                        <h4>X-Band Reflectarray and CDMA Demonstration Bus</h4>
                                        <h4>Role: ADCS Hardware and Control</h4>
                                        <img class="banner" src="images/banner_maxwell.png" />
                                        <p>MAXWELL is a 6U cubesat currently being developed as part of CU's Aerospace Graduate Projects course. The satellite mission aims to demonstrate the performance of an X-band reflectarray antenna using CDMA (code division multiple access) in the hopes that this technology will allow the ever-growing number of Earth-orbiting satellites to communicate despite crowding in the convetionally used radio bands. My involvement on the project was to extend the Attitude Determination and Control System of the QB50 mission to accomodate a new set of reaction wheels which would provide greater control authority and precision to the spacecraft. While on this project, I also assisted the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/cubequest/">CU-E3 CubeQuest mission</a> in design decisions concerning their C&amp;DH and flight software systems.</p>

                                        <h4>Ion-Neutral Mass Spectrometer 2.5U Science Bus</h4>
                                        <h4>Role: C&amp;DH and Flight Software</h4>
                                        <img class="banner" src="images/banner_qb50.png" />
                                        <p>QB50 Challenger is a 2.5U cubesat bus which hosts an Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer, provided by the Von Karman Institute in Belgium. The spacecraft is scheduled to launch to the ISS in March where it will await deployment into Low-Earth Orbit for just under a year. My role on the project was that of software/firmare engineer as part of the Command and Data Handling system team. With this, I was responsible for rigorously testing the software used to handle commands sent from the gound station, which would be interpretted and forwarded the appropriate subsystem. Additionally, I was the developer for the ground station user interface which gathered and reported all of the telemetry sent to and received from the spacecraft. Over the summer of 2016, I worked as an employee of the Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Reseach to continue work on this project with a small group of other students. Over this period, we conducted two thermal-vacuum tests of the spacecraft and conducted a rigorous set of flight-readiness tests on the spacecraft bus and its INMS payload, including several long-range communications tests which tested the robustness of the C&amp;DH's ability to perform an upload and flash of an ADCS image to the system on flight.</p>

                                        <p>The <a href="./roacketsat.html">Rocket SAT-X</a> program allows for deployable out of the rocket (once the rocket reaches an apogee of 160km). The ReEntry Experiment (ReX) Capsule was designed to be jettisoned from the rocket body, where it reentered the earth's atmosphere while taking large amounts of inertial-dynamic data relating to the amount of air resistance experienced by the vehicle body. The payload was required to survive the violent reentry process, terrestrial impact, and was to be recovered from the Atlantic Ocean several hours after launch. This project launched in August of 2011.</p>

                                        <p>This was the project which became my undergraduate thesis from the University of Northern Colorado. With Jan Chaloupka, I assembled the optical equipment used to create a two-path schlieren imaging experiment using a Mach-Zender interferometer. Abstract: The traditional arrangement for visualizing optical phenomena with the schlieren technique is modified to include a Mach-Zehnder geometry. This allows for the implementation of two independent knife edges along two different beam paths, resulting in an enhanced combined image that is uniquely adjustable. Post-processed combined images are also generated by spatially separating the paths from each arm and then colorizing and combining the images into a single composite. In this way, bidirectional, color schlieren images have been produced using both white-light and monochromatic sources.</p>

                                <p>During my time at the University of Colorado at Boulder, I've focused my studies on control systems engineering and have enrolled in several courses which explore this material (Linear Control Systems, Automatic Control Systems, and Spacecraft Attitude Dynamics and Control). These courses have all included extensive projects which have bolstered my understanding of the implamentation of these control systems concepts on physical hardware</p>
                            <subtitle>- embedded systems engineering -</subtitle>
                                <p>While outside of my declared focus area, I've spent several years exploring embedded systems design through both formal courses at CU and in personal projects. The most notable application of my knowledge in this field has been in the development of the Command and Data Handling systemused on the QB50 Challenger cubesat mission from CU. Here, I learned to implament and test robust software which would be responsible for autonomous and manual control of the spacecraft on orbit</p>
                            <subtitle>- electrical systems design -</subtitle>
                                <p>My formal education in electrical engineering accounts for only half of my experience on the subject. A robotics and mechatronics course bolstered my understanding in circuit design and component characterization, but my experience at <a href="http://www.roadnarrows.com">RoadNarrows Robotics</a> spurred my interests in electrical systems design and was responsible for my satisfactory soldering skills and for my experience with schematic capture applications</p>
                            <subtitle>- software engineering -</subtitle>
                                <p>Several projects have inspired my skills as a software engineer; the necessity for a compitent programmer has been responsible for my rapid growth in bare-metal firmware design for both educational and professional projects. I've quickly grown comfortable with C, Python, and Matlab programming languages and have had some extensive experience with implamenting my code on hardware. This includes the rigorous software testing that goes along with software implamentation (specifically concerning the Flight Software that I wrote for the QB50 Challenger cubesat mission)</p>
                            <subtitle>- mechanical design -</subtitle>
                                <p>My propensity for mechanical design has long been inspired by my fascination with mechanisms (specifically spacecraft mechanisms and structures) and the tools used to create them. With the tools and knowledge made available by the CU staff, as well as that of my peers who have mentored me, I've become compitent in using 3D printers, laser cutting tables, and mill machining.</p>

                                <p>While I will never claim to be a professional artist, I do enjoy sharing some of my doodles and drawings with anyone who might enjoy/appreciate seeing the variety in different people's drawing styles. Feel free to poke through some of the graphics that I find worth sharing <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwfJh1j5fkByRmhxN3BxN3Uxejg">here</a></p>

                                <p>As evidenced by this website, I have explored a bit about web design and web programming (although I'm truly only very experienced with HTML, PHP, and styling languages). However, I have designed a some advertising materials for RoadNarrows Robotics, MPI Probe Labs, and the Loveland CreatorSpace which I am quite proud of, some can be viewed <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwfJh1j5fkByRmhxN3BxN3Uxejg">here</a></p>
