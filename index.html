                            <!-- #TODO "Hello1" -->
                            <p>Hello there! I'm Maurice Woods - Aerospace engineer and space junky from Colorado. Born in California and raised in Southern Colorado, I've devoted myself to becoming the best, most well-rounded engineer that I can be.</p>
                            <!-- #TODO Introduction -->
                            <p>As for my formal education, I own a bachelor's of science in Physics and Astronomy, which I acquired in 2012 from the <a href="http://www.unco.edu/nhs/physics-astronomy/" target="_blank">University of Northern Colorado</a> in Greeley, CO. At present, I'm enrolled in the Masters of Aerospace Engineering program at the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/" target="_blank">University of Colorado at Boulder</a>, where I am focusing on control systems and embedded systems engineering. Since my enrollment, I've explored embedded systems (hardware and software) design, software defined radio communications systems, and spacecraft attitude dynamics, determination, and control. Additionally, I've been involved in two cubesat missions (one of which will launch in March 2017), explored small hobbyist robotics projects, and exercised my electrical and software development and debugging skills as a project consultant and a Teaching Assistant at CU's Integrated Technology and Learning Laboratory.</p>
                            <!-- #TODO Navigation -->
                            <p>I have compiled a portfolio of my notable <a href="#projects">projects</a> and <a href="#skills">skills</a> in the hopes that you might find something interesting! If, by chance, you'd care to contact me, consider my contact information found in the preamble of my <a href="documents/Woods_Resume.pdf">resume</a>.</p>
                            <!-- #TODO More on UNC -->
                            <img class="banner" src="images/mo_satellite.jpg">
                            <p>As I say in the introduction of my <a href="documents/Woods_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>: "A Multidisciplinary scientist-made-engineer eager to apply my acquired knowledge and skills in a collaborative engineering environment to further mankind’s space-faring capabilities through the application of embedded systems and spacecraft  control systems technologies, spurring the curiosity of next-generation scientists to explore the frontiers of science." While this holds true in principle, it is, admittedly, a statement that does not capture how great my passion is for space and the technology that we use to explore it. In many ways, due to the fact that my undergraduate university did not offer a formal engineering curriculum, many of my early skills and projects were products purely of my curiosity, my love for learning, and my drive to be part of something worthwhile, fascinating, and (hopefully) new. I’ve surrounded myself with people who share my passions and who push me to be better and learn more through their example, and relish the opportunities to work on projects with people who either have little experience in my field (people I can teach) or who have experience in subjects that I know little about (projects that can teach me something entirely new). Whether it be the restoration of an old Newtonian reflector telescope at my <a href="https://lovelandcreatorspace.com/">local Makerspace</a>, helping improve the control of my roommate’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mM_6oO89ak">Battle Bot “Poison Arrow”</a>, or enrolling in a communications class in order to become more knowledgeable of the other subsystem’s in my cubesat project, I am always hungry for more things to learn.</p>

                                        <h4>Ion-Neutral Mass Spectrometer 2.5U Science Bus</h4>
                                        <h4><span class="highlight">Role:</span> C&amp;DH and Flight Software <a href="#qb50" style="float:right">More on QB50 >>></a></h4>

                                        <p>QB50 Challenger is a 2.5U cubesat bus which hosts an Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer, provided by the Von Karman Institute in Belgium. The spacecraft is scheduled to launch to the ISS in March where it will await deployment into Low-Earth Orbit for just under a year. My role on the project was that of software/firmware engineer as part of the Command and Data Handling system team. With this, I was responsible for rigorously testing the software used to handle commands sent from the ground station, which would be interpreted and forwarded the appropriate subsystem. Additionally, I was the developer for the ground station user interface which gathered and reported all of the telemetry sent to and received from the spacecraft. Over the summer of 2016, I worked as an employee of the Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research to continue work on this project with a small group of other students. Over this period, we conducted two thermal-vacuum tests of the spacecraft and conducted a rigorous set of flight-readiness tests on the spacecraft bus and its INMS payload, including several long-range communications tests which tested the robustness of the C&amp;DH's ability to perform an upload and flash of an ADCS image to the system on flight.</p>

                                        <p>MAXWELL is a 6U cubesat currently being developed as part of CU's Aerospace Graduate Projects course. The satellite mission aims to demonstrate the performance of an X-band reflectarray antenna using CDMA (code division multiple access) in the hopes that this technology will allow the ever-growing number of Earth-orbiting satellites to communicate despite crowding in the conventionally used radio bands. My involvement on the project was to extend the Attitude Determination and Control System of the QB50 mission to accommodate a new set of reaction wheels which would provide greater control authority and precision to the spacecraft. While on this project, I also assisted the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/cubequest/">CU-E3 CubeQuest mission</a> in design decisions concerning their C&amp;DH and flight software systems.</p>

                                        <p>The <a href="./roacketsat.html">Rocket SAT-X</a> program allows for deployable out of the rocket (once the rocket reaches an apogee of 160km). The ReEntry Experiment (ReX) Capsule was designed to be jettisoned from the rocket body, where it reentered the earth's atmosphere while taking large amounts of inertial-dynamic data relating to the amount of air resistance experienced by the vehicle body. The payload was required to survive the violent reentry process, terrestrial impact, and was to be recovered from the Atlantic Ocean several hours after launch. This project launched in August of 2011.</p>

                                        <p>This was the project which became my undergraduate thesis from the University of Northern Colorado. With Jan Chaloupka, I assembled the optical equipment used to create a two-path schlieren imaging experiment using a Mach-Zender interferometer. Abstract: The traditional arrangement for visualizing optical phenomena with the schlieren technique is modified to include a Mach-Zehnder geometry. This allows for the implementation of two independent knife edges along two different beam paths, resulting in an enhanced combined image that is uniquely adjustable. Post-processed combined images are also generated by spatially separating the paths from each arm and then colorizing and combining the images into a single composite. In this way, bidirectional, color schlieren images have been produced using both white-light and monochromatic sources.</p>

                                            <p>First, let me say: as I am not a particularly gifted writer, <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/2017/04/18/we-have-liftoff-student-built-satellite-launches-cape-canaveral">here is a link</a> to a very well-written article concerning QB50 and the CU Boulder Aerospace Cubesat team</p>
                                            <p>This mission, which was just launched to the ISS and is awaiting deployment in mid-May, was a student-lead project intended to provide a complete 2.5U cubesat but for a 3rd party science payload (an INMS from the European institute VKI). My role focused on flight software, particularly for the Command and Data Handling systems (using a PIC18 microcontroller), and Ground Station software and testing. This involved creating a task-based operations manager which managed the execution of each of the CDH's responsibilities, including interactions with the ADCS (e.g. task negotiation and timing), communication with the Ground station (e.g. data packet handling and telemetry generation and interpretation), communication with and command of the science instrument (INMS; complete with rigorous testing as requested by our customer, VKI), and other base-system functions (radio operations scheduling, battery heater monitoring, and sensor polling/interpretation). The ground system used was a utility developed by CU's LASP (application called HYDRA) which I was responsible for outlining, designing, implementing, and managing as part of the day-in-the-life and TVAC testing processes and for upcoming flight operations. This involved a thorough characterization of the spacecraft's sensors and the CDH's handling of such data (tested heavily during TVAC) and a full understanding o the packet structure used to interface the ground station through the transceiver and to/from the cubesat's communications system. I expect to be involved in the flight operations of the satellite upon deployment at the beginning of the summer.</p>

                                        <p>This mission is an ongoing student-lead project intended to conduct a technology demonstration of an X-band reflectarray antenna using Code Division Multiple Access communication protocol aboard a 6U cubesat. My role on the project is in the ADCS hardware and software subsystems, where I am currently involved in implementing (and contributing to on a higher level) a control algorithm with legacy hardware inherited from the QB50 mission (listed previously). So far, I have been involved in upgrading the control authority of the spacecraft to incorporate a set of three reaction wheels along with the system's preexisting magnetorquer actuators. This has involved sourcing the actual reaction wheel components, establishing a communication protocol between the wheel controllers and the ADCS computer (a Beagle Bone Black), upgrading the electronics used for attitude sensing (namely the sun heading sensors and the amplification/signal conditioning circuits which support them), and modifying the implementation of the control law to incorporate the new reaction wheel actuators. I have also acted as the ADCS systems lead for my time on this project, which has involved orienting new team members to the CU Aerospace Cubesat Teams' design standards and acting as the point man for discussions involving the ADCS's interactions/integration with other subsystems (namely the CDH). This summer, I plan to continue my work on this project as we begin to test and characterize the performance of our hardware/algorithm with EDU hardware.</p>

                                        <p>This mission, launched back in 2011, was conducted as part of the Rocket SAT-X program organized by the Colorado Space Grant Consortium at CU. At the time, I was an undergraduate at UNC in Greeley, Colorado, studying physics. My role on this project was that of a project manager. I was responsible for communicating with our launch organizers and program directors at CU and organized all of the literature and materials for the various design reviews, presentations, and workshops involved with the Rocket SAT-X program. In addition to management, I was heavily involved in learning the systems developed by my project team members; this is where, as a physics student, I made my first moves toward engineering. I was responsible, in part, for the design of the payload's structure and for the integration/assembly of the electrical power system of the payload. Once the design and assembly of the payload were complete, I was the lead test engineer, where I lead the efforts to characterize the performance of the IMU and temperature sensors used to gather data upon reentry.</p>

                                        <p>Sun-Spectro SAT (Balloon Payload) - During my time as an undergraduate at UNC, I was involved in several high-altitude weather balloon payload projects with the Colorado Space Grant Consortium. One notable project involved the measurement of spectral absorption patterns as a function of altitude (considering that the sun's "uniform" spectrum is filtered through the atmosphere). While this was early in my physics career and I was no more than a novice engineer, I and another student designed a payload which focused, diffracted, and recorded the sun's light spectrum over the course of a 2-hour balloon flight. While I was heavily involved in every aspect of the mission, I may highlight the work I did to understand the optical equipment used to conduct this experiment, and further, the integration of these optics to record this data for later use. This also involved the testing and design of a subsystem that was responsible for providing a suitable climate within the sensors' housing (namely for maintaining suitable operating temperatures and humidity levels considering the dramatic variation in climate with an increase with altitude)</p>

                                        <p>After graduating from UNC, I began work at a local robotics company named RoadNarrows Robotics. One of several projects that I was involved in at that time was a 5DOF robotic manipulator arm, for which I supported the electrical power system design and the user interface software design. Though a novice at the time, I successfully integrated the control scheme for using an Xbox (gaming system) controller to control the manipulator. This control interface included speed control for each actuator, various control options for variable use (e.g. relative/POV control and absolute joint control), and operational bounds for safe operations (e.g. the ability to set custom boundaries and safe-operating spaces for use in varied environments). For the electrical subsystem, I worked under the guidance of the lead electrical engineer to CAD, assemble, and debug the PCBs used to route power and data through the system. This was largely a lesson in PCB capture, but also involved some investigation into USB communication and circuit debugging (including debugging filtering and communications circuitry). As this system was designed to work with other products produced by RoadNarrows (namely a 4-wheeled mobile robotic platform), I gained experience in designing modular and expandable systems though this project.</p>
